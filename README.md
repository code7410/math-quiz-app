# About Me

I'm Aayan, a Year 9 student learning to code with Python. This is one of my first complete projects, and I built it to understand how logic, loops, user interaction and file saving work together.

# 🧮 Math Quiz App

A Python console application that generates random math questions, tracks the user's score, time taken, and selected difficulty level (easy, medium, hard), and logs the results to a text file.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Generates 5 random addition problems  
- Takes user input and checks correctness  
- Tracks score and total time taken  
- Logs results to a `.txt` file

---

## 📁 Files

- [`math_quiz_app.py`](./math_quiz_app.py) — Main Python file  
- [`score_log.txt`](./score_log.txt) — Score tracker

## 📈 What I Learned

- Python basics: `input()`, `for loop`, `if/else`, `random`, `time`
- How to structure a program logically
- How to use GitHub to share code

✨ _This is my first Python project. More coming soon!_
